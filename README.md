GameDev
=======

Game development projects utilising pygame libraries as the backend. The games are essentially all copies of old games
as I am making them to gain experience in creating games from scratch. For more interesting ports of games then look
at my Unity3D projects, which are also on going.

Current games:

 1. Pong:  semi-functioning pong game for 2 players. Scoring continues forever.
 2. Snake: based on the game found on your phones. This will store the best high score in a file.
 3. Pacman: based on the arcade game. TBC.
